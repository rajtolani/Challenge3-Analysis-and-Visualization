### Challenge3-Analysis-and-Visualization
This Challenge was very helpful in consolidating the knowledge in the following areas

    pandas Dataframes and series. Very powerful library. Has support for everything I have needed so far. Hope to use this to do more powerful analysis

    Jupyter Lab : Jupyter Lab has been challenging for me. But this excercise has nade me feel more comfortable and I am now starting to see some benefit. I still think for real application development there are other IDE's which ould be more suitable
    
    Plotting : THe plotting support in pandas is incredible. 
    
 I do need to learn how to do Markdown files better in Jupyter Environment. Will work on this in the coming week
